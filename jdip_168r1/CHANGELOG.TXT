jDip 1.6.9 Preview Release 1 Changelog
======================================
For best results, it is recommended that Java 5 (1.5) is used to run jDip.

- Bugs not yet fixed:
    + Judge import bugs; judge import is largely not working.
    + Variant directory issues on Linux
    + Menu for displayed names may not match what is actually displayed
    + Ancient Med variant: Supply Centers not drawn
    + Sending bug reports needs visual feedback of submission progress
    + Parts of the help documentation are out-of-date.
- Bugs that cannot be duplicated:
  Please contact us with more information!
    + [1051166] copying orders to clipboard
    + [1116567] Map->Jpeg exports hangs jDip
    + [1084155] Errors in enter multiple orders breaks menu
    + XJFileDialog already-in-use bug (submitted online)
- New or Improved Features:
    + Ancient Med variant and symbols added (thanks to Stefano Costantini)
    + Renaissance variant added (thanks to Ian Scrivins)
    + Smaller (by more than 1 MB) and faster.
    + New commandline option: "-defaultgui". This forces jDip to the default
      GUI, without any enhancements. Use this if jDip will not start (this may
      happen on some versions of Linux). This option has not been extensively
      tested, and feedback regarding its use would be helpful.
    + Online bug submission (which occurs with severe jDip errors) is now more
      detailed.
    + Improved logging: logging occurs to a circular memory buffer, enabling
      more helpful and detailed online bug reports.
    + Open dialogs now are closed if a new variant is loaded or opened.
    + Splash screen changed to original pastel style.
    + Upgraded rendering system to Batik 1.6.
    + Upgraded other dependencies to new versions.
- Fixed bugs
    + Impossible Rick-click on a Mac [1124808]
        - Command + Mouse button emulates right button
        - Shift + Mouse button emulates middle button 
    + jDip doesn't start under Linux [1053723]
        - Should jDip not start with some versions of Linux, try the 
          "-defaultgui" option on the command line.
    + jDip does not see Shortcut Folders [1051678]
        - This works with Java 5 (1.5). This is a known problem with some 
          versions of Java 1.4.x. 
    + Adjudication error: No convoy, but bounce [1205531, 1116568, 1053458]
        - This is now fixed. As it turns out, one of the test cases 
          had an incorrect resolution that masked this bug in prior versions.
    + Variant Modern: Parsing error "Eastern Mediterranean" [1205550, 1205534]
    + Parse error using judge result build phase [1205547]
        - "Enter multiple orders" dialog now supports judge build orders
    + Importing from floc.net hangs indefinitely [1158290]
        - This cannot be reliable duplicated, but can occur if floc.net is 
          down or responding slowly.
    + Deleting of single orders does not work [1005872, 1118742]
    + Map name/report discrepancy [1184073]
    + Loeb9, STP fleet should start NC not SC [1066690]
    + Cannot import - underscore not supported [1117835]
        - Underscores are now supported in judge game names
    + Many subtle order parsing errors were fixed.
    + DPJudge Chaos map now works.
    + Face-to-Face mode errors fixed.
    + Exceptions should no longer occur when jDip exits.
    + NullPointerException occured with empty parenthetical coasts in 
      Coast.normalize().
    + Hundred map fixes.
- Compatibility:
    + Saved Face-to-Facd (F2F) games from previous versions cannot be opened
	  in this version due to extensive fixes.

		Danny Loeb's 9 player variant to diplomacy follows the standard rules
		of the Adjudicator with the following exceptions:
		<div style="margin-top:0.5cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		<b>8th player:</b>
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.15cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		Spain is divided into four regions:
		<ul>
		<li><b>Navarre:</b>   	Adjacent to the Mid Atlantic, Gascony, Catalonia, Madrid 
					   			and Portugal.</li>
		<li><b>Madrid:</b>    	Adjacent to Portugal, Navarre, Catalonia and Cordoba.</li>
		<li><b>Catalonia:</b> 	Adjacent to Cordoba, Madrid, Navarre, Gascony, Marseilles,
					   			Gulf of Lyon and Western Mediterranean.</li>
		<li><b>Cordoba:</b>   	Adjacent to Portugal, Madrid, Catalonia, Western Mediterranean
					   			and the Mid Atlantic.</li>
		</ul>			   
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		Madrid and Cordoba are supply centers.
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		The Spanish player begins with Fleet Portugal, Army Cordoba and Army Madrid.
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		The following islands are now spaces: Iceland, Ireland, Corsica, Sardinia
		and Sicily.
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		Ireland is a neutral supply center.
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		Passage between Cordoba and North Africa and passage between Naples and
		Sicily is allowed by armies.  However, such a move is made with a force
		equal to the number of supports (as opposed to one plus the number of
		supports).  Note that fleets may not make this move and support cannot
		be given in this fashion.  This form of movement is treated very much
		like convoyed movement by the adjudicator.  An unsupported unit will
		have no effect whatsoever on the destination province for the purposes
		of cutting support or banning retreats.
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.5cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		<b>9th player:</b>
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		An extra space is inserted on the north end of the map called the
		Arctic Ocean.  A unit in the Arctic Ocean may not be given any sort of
		orders durning a fall turn.  No unit may attempt to move into the
		Arctic Ocean during a fall turn.  The Arctic Ocean is adjacent to the
		North Atlantic, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea and Siberia.
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		St Petersburg is divided in half.  The eastern half is not a supply center.
		It is called Siberia and it is adjacent to Barents Sea, St Petersburg,
		Moscow, Kazakz and the Arctic Ocean.
		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		Moscow is divided in half.  The eastern half is not a supply center.
		It is called Kazakz and is is adjacent to Siberia, Moscow and
		Sevastople.
		</div>
		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">

		<div style="margin-top:0.25cm;font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		The normal rules of the game of Diplomacy apply, with the following additions,

		simply clarify where units may or may not move. If you are familiar with the normal rules

		</div>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Victory Criteria</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			18 supply centers. This is a simple majority (it's just coincidence that 
			Ancient Med has the same number of supply centers as the standard game). 
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Move Dates and Adjustments</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			Each turn alternates between Spring and Fall, starting the game on a Spring turn, 
			with adjustments being made after a Fall turn. Each successive Spring the year 
			increases by one. This is just like the standard game except the variant�s first year is 
			01 AD instead of 1901 AD. 
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Impassable Spaces</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			Any areas that are not named on the board are not passable. 
			The Atlantic Ocean can not be occupied by any units.  
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Islands</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			Islands are distinct spaces. An island may be occupied by an army or a fleet. 
			Each island has one continuous coast, therefore a fleet on an island may move 
			to any space adjacent to it. For example, a fleet could move from the Egyptian 
			Sea to Crete in one turn, and then move to the Aegean Sea in the next turn.  
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Movement Across Narrow Straits</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			Arrows on the board indicate two adjacent land (coastal) spaces. An army may 
			move from one space to the other in one turn without being convoyed. Because 
			they are adjacent, fleets may also move from one space to the other in one turn. 
			Note that the Tyrrhenean Sea is adjacent to the Ausonian Sea.  
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Byzantium</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			Byzantium is one space which straddles a waterway. The waterway allows movement 
			of a fleet in Byzantium to any adjacent coastal space or sea space. The waterway 
			does not impede the movement of an army through Byzantium. And it is a supply center. 
			In other words, it works just like Constantinople in the standard game.  
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Baleares</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			Baleares is a single space (which consists of the islands and the water around them). 
			Since it contains both land and water, it can be occupied by a fleet or an army. However, 
			since it is a single space, it can only be occupied by one unit at a time. Although an army 
			can occupy Baleares, it can not move there directly from the mainland spaces since the 
			islands are too far from the coast. For an army to enter or leave Baleares, it would have 
			to be convoyed by a fleet in the Berber Sea or the Ligurian Sea. Since Baleares consists 
			mostly of water, it is considered a sea space for the purposes of convoys, therefore a
			fleet occupying Baleares may be used to convoy an army using the normal convoy rules. 
			Baleares is a supply center.  
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Four-way Intersection in the High Seas</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			In the middle of the board there is an area where four sea spaces come together at one point.
			They are the Ausonian Sea, Messenian Sea, Gulf of Tacape and Libyan Sea. All four of these 
			spaces are adjacent to each of the other three at that point. Therefore, a fleet in one of 
			these spaces may move to any of the other three. In other words, a fleet in any of these 
			spaces may move diagonally.
			<p>
			By virtue of the expanse of the open seas, fleets can pass each other in a criss-cross fashion 
			without impeding each others' movement. For example, a Roman fleet could move from the Ausonian 
			Sea to the Libyan Sea and a Greek fleet could move from the Messenian Sea to the Gulf of Tacape 
			on the same turn and both of these moves would be allowed. Note that this criss-crossing is not
			the same as two units exchanging places. For example, if a Roman fleet tried to move from the 
			Ausonian Sea to the Libyan Sea and an Egyptian fleet tried to move from the Libyan Sea to the 
			Ausonian Sea on the same turn, these moves would not be allowed due to the normal rules.  
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The Diolkos</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			The border between Sparta and Athens effectively works like a canal. It cuts across the 
			isthmus and allows fleets to move through. For example, a fleet in the Aegean Sea could move
			to Athens and then, on the following turn, to the Ionian Sea. Note that in game terms, this
			means Athens effectively has one continuous coast. Armies can freely move between Sparta and
			Athens.
			<p>
			The historical precedence for this is not an actual canal. The Diolkos was a roadway built 
			by the Greeks for the purpose of moving ships across the isthmus on large wheeled carts. 
			You can still see the ruts in the ground today. See Ancient Diolkos of Corinth and The 
			Diolkos and the Corinth Canal.  
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The Nile River and Canal</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			The Nile River acts as the boundary between the spaces on its east and west banks. The river 
			is not a space on the board. It can not be occupied by any units. However, it is considered to 
			be navigable. Therefore, a fleet may move to and from spaces that are adjacent along the river.
			For example, Sinai to Thebes, Thebes to Memphis, Memphis to Alexandria would all be legal moves
			for a fleet. Memphis to Cyrene would not be a legal move for a fleet. Egypt can build fleets in
			any of its home supply centers.
			<p>
			There is also a canal that connects the Nile River Delta to the Reed Sea. It acts as the 
			boundary between Sinai and Thebes. It is also navigable and therefore allows fleet movement 
			between Sinai, Thebes and Reed Sea. Reed Sea is not adjacent to the Gulf of Pelusium or 
			Alexandria. Notice that due to the various waterways and coastlines, Sinai and Thebes each 
			have one continuous coast.
			<p>
			Armies can freely move across the Nile River and canal.
			<p>
			There actually is much precedence for a canal connecting the Nile River to Reed Sea in 
			ancient history. It required constant dredging to keep it clear of sand and therefore was 
			subject to long periods in history of not being navigable (although this spuratic 
			availablitly is not reflected in the game). See Pharaonic Egypt: Canals and Ancient 
			Economies (this second article is long and does not deal with the canal directly, so search 
			for the word "canal" using your browser's find command).  
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">The Nile River Delta</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			The Nile Delta is not a distinct space on the board. It can not be occupied by any units. 
			There are four spaces which are in contact with the delta. They are Alexandria, Thebes, 
			Sinai and the Gulf of Pelusium. All four of these spaces are considered to be adjacent to 
			each of the other three, at all times, by virtue of the multiple water channels in the delta. 
			This provides increased flexibility concerning the movement of fleets. A fleet in any of these
			four spaces may move to any of the other three. The delta does not impede the movement of 
			armies. An army in any of the three land spaces in contact with the delta, may move to 
			either of the other two.
			<p>
			The key to remember is that Thebes is always adjacent to the Gulf of Pelusium <b>and</b> 
			Alexandria is always adjacent to Sinai (in addition to the obvious adjacancies). For example, 
			a fleet could move from Thebes to the Gulf of Pelusium and, on the same turn, an army or 
			a fleet, could move from Alexandria to Sinai. It should be noted that this criss-crossing 
			is not the same as two units exchanging places which is not allowed.
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Convoy Clarifications</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			As in the normal rules, no fleet in a land space can convoy armies. This includes 
			any coastal space, island, Byzantium and land spaces adjacent to the Nile River or 
			the delta. Baleares is considered primarily a sea space for the purposes of convoys, 
			therefore a fleet occupying it may be used to convoy an army using the normal convoy rules. 
			</font>
		<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Abbreviations for Ancient Med Names</font></h2>
			<font face="Arial, Helvetica">
			For almost every space on the board, the first three letters of the name are used for 
			its abbreviation. This includes spaces which have two words in the name. So the Egyptian 
			Sea is "Egy" and the Cilician Strait is "Cil". None of the letters in the words "sea" or 
			"strait" are used. However, names that have three words in them use the first letter of 
			each of the three words. So the Gulf of Pelusium is "GoP". There are only a few exceptions 
			to these guidelines due to redundancies. The following is a complete list of the exceptions 
			to the "use the first three letters" rule.
			<ul>
				<li>Gulf of Pelusium = GoP</li>
				<li>Gulf of Syrtis = GoS</li>
				<li>Gulf of Tacape = GoT</li>
				<li>Sardinia = Sad</li>
				<li>Sarmatia = Sam</li>
				<li>Sinai = Sii</li>
				<li>Sinope = Sip</li>
				<li>Tyre = Tye</li>
				<li>Tyrrhenean Sea = Tyn</li>
			</ul>

		than four years.  Several email and quite a few live games later, here are the

		</div>
		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;margin-top:0.5cm">
		Note that there are absolutely no rule changes from the standard Dip rulebook.
		Just a new map.  Comments: canals are similar to Constantinople in the regular
		Vanilla game; ie fleets and armies may cross, but only one may be occupying
		the territory at a time. Asian Diplomacy has almost no historical basis.

		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;margin-top:0.5cm">
		The original designers of the variant said "It is VERY well balanced, which 
		should be the final criteria for a wargame.  All powers have equal chances to 
		win." However, experience says that this is not the case. Some powers are much
		stronger than others. It is also very easy to stalemate the game, which makes
		solo wins unlikely, and draws much more likely.

		<b>NOTE: Only a grid test map exists for this variant.</b>
		</div>
		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;margin-top:0.25cm;">
		Modern Diplomacy is intended to be diplomacy with an updated map,
		circa 1994, taking place in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.
		Any country with more than 30 million inhabitants was made a power.
		Those with more than 60 million inhabitants were given 4 home centers,
		while Russia (with 200 million plus) was given 5. Iran would have
		qualified as a 4 supply center power, but this would have made it
		necessary to extend the map into Asia, so it was not done.
		</div>
		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;margin-top:0.5cm">
		Historically, we have to consider that the European Community and
		all international alliances and organizations such as NATO and the
		UN were broken down. Perhaps the United States suffered a major
		cataclysm, or simply decided to ignore the outside world - but in
		any case, it will not intervene in Europe.
		</div>
		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;margin-top:0.5cm">
		Other than this, borders and neutral supply centers were distributed
		to even out the game. Monaco was made a neutral SC (it has lots 
		of money) even though it's size does not warrant it, and Gibraltar was
		made a British home SC, both to give Britain a port in the Mediterranean,
		and to give Spain more than one neighbour). 
		</div>
		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;margin-top:0.5cm">
		There is also another type of unit optionally available, the wing.
		Wings can go over water and land but can not capture a
		supply center. Therefore, if France manages to move a plane over London,
		England would still own it, but not be able to build there. 
		Only the three 'nuclear' powers have wings available at the start
		(Britain, France and Russia) though any power can build them.
		</div>
		<h2 style="font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		Notes on Geography
		</h2>
		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		Cairo, Hamburg and Istanbul behave as Kiel and Constantinople did in the
		original game: they have no coasts but fleets can pass through them to
		bodies of water of both sides.
		</div>
		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;margin-top:0.5cm">
		There is another canal linking Rostov and Volga, thus permitting
		access to the Caspian Sea to ships. Rostov is situated along the
		Don River which empties into the Black Sea, while the Volga empties
		into the Caspian Sea. In the real world there is a canal at Volgograd
		linking the two rivers, somewhere in the southern Volga region on
		the map. This is the only way to get ships into and out of the
		Caspian Sea.
		</div>
		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;margin-top:0.5cm">
		Iran is the only territory with multiple coasts in the game--the south 
		coast touches the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf, while the north coast
		touches the Caspian Sea.
		</div>
		<h2 style="font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		Abbreviations
		</h2>
		<div style="font-family:arial,helvetica;">
		Abbreviations for territories are the first 3 letters of the territory,
		except for:
